# AnticShop

Antic shop project


This is my first project. I created a project with basic functionality using thyme leaves and spring.
Then I upgrade it with java spring security. This is a direct ordering site. There are parts of Bulgarian history. You can see it, enjoy it or buy it.

There are test users entered.
Admin username: ADMIN
Users: 1. username: niki 2. username: zaza.

Error handling: global controller advice for object not found. The white label error page has been replaced with a custom 404.html and 500.html page.
Scheduling task - every last day of the month all users who are not active are deleted.
